An AI-powered quality control agent that inspects open shipping boxes before sealing, prevents costly fulfillment errors, and leaves a cryptographic audit trail for 3PLs and self-fulfilling sellers.

## Kill condition
If the False Positive Rate (where the AI tells the operator to SEAL a box that is actually missing items or contains wrong items) exceeds 1.0% in warehouse staging.

## 💡 The Solution

In high-volume fulfillment operations, packing mistakes lead to returns, expensive reshipments, and retailer chargebacks.
**Pack Manager AI** acts as a sub-second visual gatekeeper at the packing table:
1. Overhead cameras snap an image of the open shipping carton.
2. The agent compares visual contents against the expected order lines.
3. It issues a deterministic operational verdict (**SEAL**, **STOP & FIX**, **UNCERTAIN**, or **PENDING**).
4. Every decision is cryptographically hashed and saved in the `contract/` folder for non-repudiation.

## ⚡ Setup & Execution

### Running via Streamlit Community Cloud
The application is designed with a dual-mode architecture and is actively deployed. You do not need to run it locally to evaluate it.
1. Visit the live URL at the top of this README.
2. Open the **⚙️ Settings > 🔑 API Key Config** sidebar.
3. Paste your Gemini API key and click **Validate Key**.
4. Upload an image and verify!

### Running Locally
```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Add API key to environment
# Edit agent/.env to include GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"

# 3. Start Backend (Terminal 1)
cd agent
uvicorn main:app --reload --env-file .env --port 8000

# 4. Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
streamlit run app.py
```

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions
1. **Lighting and Angle:** We assume the packing station has adequate lighting and an overhead camera providing a clear, top-down perspective into the open carton.
2. **Tenant Isolation:** All requests are isolated across distinct 3PL warehouse clients via the `x-org-id` header to guarantee Row-Level Security.

### Limitations / Failure Modes
1. **Vertical Textile Occlusion:** Identical folded soft goods (e.g. 3 stacked black shirts) cannot be counted accurately if the bottom layers are fully hidden.
2. **Identical Packaging in Varied Sizes:** Products sharing exact identical box designs without readable text require manual barcode scan pairing.
3. **Opaque Sub-Packaging:** Items inside sealed opaque polybags (like screws or cables) cannot be inspected internally by the vision model.
